> ### ABOUT MYSELF :  

Currently I am working as an architect and CG artist in APA Wojciechowski (largest architectural firm in Poland with over 120 employees).  

Also, I found of programing in my free time. I would like to improve my basic knowledge and skills in the field of front-end development, UX and UI design.
Sense of style, artistic approach and ability to create different concepts in short deadlines are definitely my most valuable assets, which I earned working as an architectural designer. Thats why I found front-end development so interesting, because I can interact with the visual side of the project.
